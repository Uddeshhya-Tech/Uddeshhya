          The “UPHAAR” Project aims to bring smiles to people’s faces and help
          those in need by giving them happiness. It focuses on spreading joy
          and providing support to those who require assistance.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md mb-2">
          In our project, we hope that no one will go without clothes or shiver
          in the cold during winter, and that no one will go hungry. We strive
          to provide warmth, nourishment, and comfort to those in need. By
          distributing clothing, food, and other essential items, we aim to
          alleviate suffering and ensure that everyone has the basic necessities
          for a dignified life. Our mission is to create a supportive community
          . Through collective efforts, we can bring light and hope to those
          facing hardships, fostering a sense of unity and compassion in our
          society.

            Cloth Collection Drive :
          </span>{" "}
          During the winter season, we will be collecting clothes and blankets
          from all the college hostels (both boys and girls), as well as PG
          accommodations. Our aim is to donate these warm clothes to the
          residents of slums, ( Ravli and Rajnagar). Additionally, we will
          extend our donations to our college staff, including guards, mess
          workers, and cleaners ensuring that everyone has access to warm and
          suitable attire, particularly during the harsh winter months.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md mb-2">
          <span className="font-medium mr-1 underline">IYYANAT :</span> Every
          year, as the 4th-year students graduate and leave behind some of their
          belongings, we have an opportunity to collect these items and donate
          them to those in need. By doing so, we can bring smiles to many faces
          and make a positive impact on our community. These donated items can
          include clothes, books, stationery, and other useful materials that
          can significantly benefit the underprivileged. This initiative not
          only helps reduce waste but also fosters a spirit of generosity and
          care among our students.

        <p className="text-md mb-2">
          <span className="font-medium mr-1 underline">Deepotsav :</span>
          Deepotsav is our annual event celebrating Diwali. Our team sets up
          stalls with games, handicrafts, and a wishing well where slum
          residents and evening school students can share their Diwali wishes
          with us. The main highlight of this event is the handicraft, all
          created by the Uddeshhya team.
          <span className="block">
            During Deepotsav, we collect wishes from the community to understand
            what they would like as Diwali gifts from us. This allows us to
            spread joy and make their celebrations brighter. By involving
            everyone in our festivities, we aim to foster a spirit of
            togetherness and kindness.

          conduct various distributions throughout the year. These include
          providing food, stationary items, sanitary napkins, shoes, and more to
          those in need. These distributions aim to address immediate needs and
          improve the quality of life for the recipients. Each distribution
          event is an opportunity for us to reach out and lend a helping hand to
          those facing challenges.
