          This campaign is dedicated to raising awareness about the Armed Forces
          (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) and supporting the cause championed by
          Irom Sharmila. We conduct seminars, discussions, and distribute

          Recognizing the power of information, our RTI (Right to Information)
          awareness drive aims to educate citizens about their rights to access
          information from public authorities. Workshops, training sessions, and
          distribution of RTI forms are integral parts of this drive, empowering
          individuals to exercise their rights.

        </h4>
        <p className="text-md mb-2">
          To effectively communicate messages against social evils, we organize
          skits and Nukkads (street plays) in various locations. These
          performances are designed to be engaging and thought-provoking,
          addressing issues such as corruption, gender discrimination, domestic
          violence, and substance abuse. By using a creative medium, we aim to
          reach a wider audience and provoke discussions on these critical
          topics.
