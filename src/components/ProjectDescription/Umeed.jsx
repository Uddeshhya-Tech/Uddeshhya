          By keeping this in mind, Team UDDESHHYA, started their project “UMEED”
          which lighten up the hopes of our mess workers who want to study but
          couldn’t do it due to lack of resources and uncertain circumstances or
          conditions. This project by our team was started in the year 2010, Our
          team embarked on a project with hope when we observed the mess workers
          at our college, recognizing their desire to learn despite their
          challenging circumstances. They yearned to improve their literacy
          skills, yet struggled due to their life situations. This inspired us
          to initiate a project aimed at providing literacy education tailored
          to their needs. We believed that through education, they could
          overcome barriers and achieve personal growth. Our hope was that by
          supporting them in acquiring fundamental moral skills, we could
          empower them to enhance their lives and futures.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md mb-2">
          The workers in the mess also have dreams of leaving this behind and
          progressing through education and hard work, but they are unable to do
          so due to certain circumstances. They also wish to become successful
          individuals and bring honor to their parents names. When the students
          of our college noticed this, they began teaching these mess workers,
          and our team hoped that these workers dreams would come true if we
          educated them well and they also worked hard. That&aposs why we named
          our project “Umeed”, meaning hope.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md mb-2">
          Under this project, we involves tutoring the mess workers every night,
          providing them with resources based on their existing knowledge, and
          developing an academic curriculum for them. Additionally, we
          facilitate their admission into government schools according to their
          knowledge levels and conduct daily classes to assist them in achieving
          good grades in their classes. This holistic approach aims to empower
          them academically and support their aspirations for a better future,
          ensuring they have the tools and encouragement to succeed in their
          educational endeavors. We also prepare them for various competitive
          examinations according to their academic qualifications.

          In addition to academic tutoring, our initiative also focuses on
          instilling moral values and promoting personal hygiene among the mess
          workers. We believe that education goes beyond textbooks; it
          encompasses developing a well-rounded individual who understands the
          importance of ethics and maintaining good personal health. Through our
          program, we emphasize the significance of honesty, respect, and
          compassion in daily life. We also educate them about the importance of
          cleanliness, proper sanitation practices, and personal grooming. By
          integrating these aspects into their education, we aim to empower them
          not only academically but also as individuals capable of leading
          healthy, dignified lives. Our goal is to nurture their overall
          development and equip them with essential life skills that will serve
          them well in their journey towards a brighter future.

        <p className="text-md mb-10">
          Alongside our educational efforts, we strive to create a supportive
          and inclusive community for the mess workers by celebrating every
          festival together, distributing food and clothing, and endeavoring to
          share in their joys. We believe in fostering a sense of belonging and
          happiness among them, ensuring that they feel valued and cherished. By
          standing beside them during festivities, providing essential supplies,
          and sharing in moments of joy, we aim to not only uplift their spirits
          but also strengthen the bonds of empathy and solidarity within our
          community. Our commitment extends beyond education to encompass
          holistic support, nurturing a compassionate environment where every
          individual&apos;s dignity and well-being are upheld and celebrated.
